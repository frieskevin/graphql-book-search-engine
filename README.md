# GraphQL Google Book Search App

### This is a Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API that I refactored to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.  
### The app was build using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API originally.
### You can sign up, log in, and save books to your account.
